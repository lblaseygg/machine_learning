# Machine Learning Projects

This repository serves as a collection of my machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. Each project will be organized in its own directory, containing all necessary code, data, and documentation.

## Overview

This repository contains various ML/AI projects that I work on while learning and experimenting with different concepts and techniques. Each project is self-contained and includes its own documentation, requirements, and resources.

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository will be organized in its own directory with a consistent structure:

```
project_name/
├── README.md          # Project-specific documentation
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
├── data/             # Project datasets
├── src/              # Source code
├── notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks
└── models/           # Trained models
```

## Technologies

Projects in this repository may use various ML/AI technologies including:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Other ML/AI libraries as needed

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific project directory you're interested in
2. Follow the project-specific README for setup instructions
3. Install the project dependencies
4. Run the code or explore the notebooks
